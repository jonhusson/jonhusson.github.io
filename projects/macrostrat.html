		  <p class="text-justify"> For over 100 years, geoscientists have appreciated that 
		  Earth's climate and surface chemistry is mediated by mass exchange with the lithosphere 
		  \citep{Chamberlin1899a}. In Earth history research, arguably no element has received more attention 
		  than carbon, owing to its dual role as a planetary thermostat \citep{Walker1981a} and source of atmospheric 
		  oxygen when it is buried in sediments as photosynthetic organic matter \citep{Garrels1974a}. Due to the challenges 
		  of direct quantification of geological mass fluxes, especially at fine temporal scales, geochemical proxy studies of
		  well-constrained stratigraphic sections have emerged as a dominant mode to study ancient climate and biogeochemical 
		  cycling. My <a href="/projects/ict.html">Ph.D. research</a> was premised certainly on this approach. As the number of 
		  active geoscientists grows, and analytical approaches make the generation of large datasets more routine, the ability to 
		  discover and analyze all data relevant to a given question has become unwieldy, but increasingly important for testing 
		  the most pressing questions in Earth history. For example, the canonical model used to interpret carbon isotopic records 
		  contends that there are of two important modes of carbon burial: (1) <b>organic matter</b> and (2) <b>marine carbonate</b>. Recent work 
		  has challenged this paradigm by suggesting that  <b>authigenic carbonate</b>, precipitated from carbon released during anaerobic 
		  organic matter degradation, may be an important third sink for carbon. If correct, our understanding of the carbon cycle 
		  and global redox budgets needs to be redressed at a fundamental level. Testing this model is challenging, however, because 
		  authigenic carbonate can be disseminated over a large volume of buried sediment. Thus, rather than viewing geochemical proxies 
		  as replacements for empirical quantification of geological mass fluxes, these approaches are necessarily complementary. This 
		  challenge (and opportunity) has led me to work with  <a href="http://macrostrat.org/" target="_blank">Macrostrat</a>, a geospatial 
		  database of that describes the age and properties of rocks in the upper crust. In collaboration with  <a href="http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/Home/" target="_blank">Shanan Peters</a>,
		  I have been using Macrostrat to model sedimentary mass fluxes into and out of the lithosphere on geological timescales, and thus 
		  explore the attendant implications for climate and biogeochemical cycles.</p>
          
          <!--<p class="text-justify"> For my post-doctoral work, I have focused on studying Earth history from a 'Big Data' perspective.
          Starting in fall of 2014, I have been working with <a href="http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/Home/" target="_blank">Shanan Peters</a> and <a href="http://macrostrat.org/" target="_blank">Macrostrat</a>,
          a database that seeks to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of rocks in the upper crust (primarily in North America, but we are expanding!)
          Macrostrat serves as a platform for organizing and analyzing geological data of all types, and with it, continental scale patterns of sedimentation can
          be comprehensively quantified (<b>figure right focuses on Paleozoic carbonate distribution</b>). Possibilities for studying biogeochemical cycles of all kinds with Macrostrat
          are manifold, as exchange with the lithosphere is important for every geochemical process over geological timescales. One hypothesis I am currently testing
          with Macrostrat is assessing the importance of authigenic carbonate burial. Carbon isotopic measurements (δ¹³C) of marine carbonates are used as proxies for understanding 
          the ancient carbon cycle. When high fidelity δ¹³C time-series can be constructed, and isotopic changes in contemporaneous dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are inferred, 
          these records typically are interpreted as reflecting the relative importance of two canonical modes of carbon burial: (1) <b>organic matter</b> and (2) <b>marine carbonate</b>. 
          In this framework, temporal changes in δ¹³C result from changes in the fraction of total carbon burial as reduced carbon, which is linked directly to the redox state of 
          Earth’s surface. Recent work, however, has challenged this paradigm, by suggesting that <b>authigenic carbonate</b>, precipitated during early diagenesis, may be an important 
          'third sink' for carbon that is itself sensitive to changes in atmospheric oxygen concentrations. If this model is correct, our understanding of the carbon cycle and 
          global redox budgets needs to be redressed at a fundamental level. Testing this model is, however, challenging, as authigenic carbonate can be disseminated over a large 
          volume of sediment. Using Macrostrat, we seek to constrain the potential magnitude of the authigenic carbonate burial effect by modeling the three sinks. Because sedimentary 
          lithologies vary in their potential for burying the three phases of carbon, our analysis focuses on quantifying the North American burial flux of individual sedimentary lithotypes. 
          Across a range of reasonable parameters for weight percent organic and authigenic carbonate and their δ¹³C offsets from seawater, the predicted δ¹³C of DIC captures long-term trends seen 
          in composite δ¹³C time-series developed from marine carbonates for the past 900 Myr. Incorporating geochemical measurements into Macrostrat, aided by the machine-reading and -learning initiative 
          <a href="http://deepdive.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">GeoDeepDive</a>, will further improve the accuracy and precision of model predictions.</p>-->
