          Carbonate sedimentary rocks simultaneously record information about the physical, biological and
          chemical conditions in which they formed. Consequently, they represent rich archives of the history
          of Earth's surface, especially when geochemical or paleobiological time series are anchored firmly with 
          field observations and insight (<b>figure right, displaying chemostratigraphy from the famous outcrop of the Taconic 
          Unconformity in Catskill, NY; panorama courtesy of Adam Maloof</b>). The backbone of the carbonate chemostratigrapher's toolkit are measurements of
          &#948<sup>13</sup>C, used as a proxy to study the behavior of the global carbon cycle. Despite decades of work on 
          this subject, geologists and geochemists
          still argue about the meanings of these records, and how they should be interpreted in the context of Earth history. 
          What are the causes of positive and negative &#948<sup>13</sup>C excursions? Is the dominant signal in these
          records the operation of the global carbon cycle, or local processes, such as diagenesis or local carbon cycling?
          What can &#948<sup>13</sup>C tell us about other biogeochemical cycles, such as atmospheric oxygenation?
          Of increasing importance is the integration of these datasets with 
          <a href="http://carboncycle.princeton.edu/laboratory" target="_blank">Ca and Mg isotope datasets</a>,
          as these represent the other main chemical constituent of limestone and dolostone rocks. Our research projects in 
          this field has focused on a variety of time periods with anomalous carbon cycle behavior, including 
          the <a href="/group/#target-grunsky">Ediacaran</a>, 
          <a href="/group/#target-cappello">Ordovician</a>, <a href="/group/#target-gazdewich">Devonian</a> 
          and <a href="/group/#target-lei">Middle</a> and <a href="/group/#target-vanwieren">Late Triassic</a>. <b>&#948<sup>13</sup>C and &#948<sup>18</sup>O measurements are made 
          in SEOS at the University of Victoria on a Sercon 20-22 gas-source mass spectrometer with a Gas Box 2 front end.</b>

          	<img src="../img/tims.jpg" alt="tims" style="width: 75%; float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;">
          <p class="text-justify"> In the study of Earth history, the importance of time
          cannot be overstated. Geochronology and the development of rigorous age models 
          allows the timing, order and rates of Earth system change to be quantified, thereby
          shedding light on the fundamental processes that drive Earth system evolution. Within the sedimentary rocks we study, 
          our group is always on the look out for ash falls amenable to U-Pb dating
          on zircon using isotope-dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS), 
          in collaboration with labs such as the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/schoene/Radiogenic-Isotopes-Lab/index.xml" target="_blank"> Princeton Radiogenic Isotopes Lab</a>.
          In modern geochronological laboratories, low Pb-blank levels (< 1 pg per analysis) allows for 
          the dating of single crystals at high precision.
          <b> At the University of Victoria, we are able to extract zircons from field samples using standard 
          magnetic and heavy liquid separation techniques, as well as anneal the heavy separates to prepare them for clean lab work</b>. 
          Chemical abrasion follows the technique of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2005.03.011" target="_blank">Mattinson (2005)</a>. 
          After chemical abrasion and washing, grains are spiked with <a href="http://www.earth-time.org" target="_blank">EARTHTIME</a> tracer solution 
         (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2015.05.026" target="_blank">Condon et al 2015</a>; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2015.02.040" target="_blank">McLean et al 2015</a>)
          and dissolved fully in HF + trace HNO<sub>3</sub> (<b>figure above, left panel</b>). These techniques
          allow for high accuracy and precision dates (0.05-0.075% uncertainty (2&#963) on the measured age) and
          form the gold standard for time scale geochronology. Our research has contributed new ages to better

          <h3 align="center">Nature of the sedimentary rock record</h3>
          
          <img src="../gifs/seds_0p1s.gif" alt="ict_mthomas" style="width: 50%; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">

		  The sedimentary rock reservoir both records and influences changes in Earth's surface environment. 
		  Geoscientists extract data from the rock record to constrain long-term environmental, climatic and 
		  biological evolution (see <b>U-Pb geochronology</b> and <b>carbonate sedimentology</b> sections above),
		   with the understanding that geological processes of erosion and rock destruction may have overprinted 
		   some aspects of their results. It has also long been recognized that changes in the mass and chemical 
		   composition of buried sediments, operating in conjunction with biologically catalyzed reactions, exert 
		   a first-order control on Earth surface conditions on geologic timescales. Thus, the construction and 
		   destruction of the rock record has the potential to influence both how Earth and life history are sampled, 
		   and drive long-term trends in surface conditions that otherwise are difficult to affect. We explore these 
		   connections through <b>geological data synthesis</b> using <a href="http://macrostrat.org/" target="_blank">Macrostrat</a>, 
		   a geospatial database that describes the age and properties of rocks in the upper crust, and <a href="https://geodeepdive.org/" target="_blank">GeoDeepDive</a>,
		   a digital library designed to support scientific data mining.
		   The most basic calculation that can be derived from these resources is the quantification of rock abundance 
		   vs. rock age - for a given point in time at a given region in space, does rock exist? In the movie on the right, this quantity is shown 
		   for North America sediments (1 billion years ago to present). Does the rock record get
		   worse with age, as is commonly thought? How do records from one region of the globe compare to other regions?
		   How do such time series compare to other, significant events in Earth history, such as 
		   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2016.12.012" target="_blank">atmospheric oxygenation and biological evolution</a>? 
		   We continue to pursue data synthesis approaches to Earth history, including 
		   through the geographic expansion of Macrostrat (such as to <a href="/group/#target-fode">Australia</a>) and its enrichment with GDD-extracted 
		   data (such as <a href="/group/#target-kumpf">evaporite mineralogy</a>).</p>
